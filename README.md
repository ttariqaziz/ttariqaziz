| Topic  | Summary |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Real Estate Price Prediction AI app using FLASK Project](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/real_estate_price_prediction_AI_app_using_Flask)  | AI-Driven Predictions: ML algorithms process input data, utilizing intricate patterns to predict real estate prices. Followed by the FLASK app. |
| [TX Weather-Crime relationship using Machine Learning (Time Series Analysis)- Omdena](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/weather_crime_relationship_houston_omdena)  | End-to-end Univariate Multimodel Time Series Analysis machine learning project by building a model to evaluate and understanding the relationship between crime and weather in Houston, TX, achieved 89% accuracy, RMSE = 21.3974, R2 = 0.0836412, MSE = 457.849, and MAE = 18.5733. |
| [Twitter Text and Sentiment Analysis on COVID-19 data using NLP Project](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/twitter_text_classification_sentiment_analysis_project)  | Complete data science project focusing on Unstructured COVID-19 Twitter data to analyze sentiments and text, including data cleaning and formatting, data wrangling, Tokenization, Lemmatization, and EDA. TD-IDF, feature selection to Machine Learning models using Natural Language Processing followed by hyperparameter tuning and feature importance, achieved 64% training and 63% testing accuracy. |
| [New York Airbnb Price Prediction using Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/nyc_airbnb_price_prediction_project)  | This is an end-to-end data science pipeline project that involves predicting the price of Airbnb listings across the five boroughs of New York, achieved R-squared = 57%, MSE = 0.19, MAE = 0.14. |
| [H&M Fashion Recommendation System using Machine Learning project](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/h-m_recommendation_system_ml_project) | I developed and implemented an exploratory data analysis system for H&M products, utilizing a large 32GB dataset that includes images. The system aims to offer customers enhanced personalized product insights, scraped images from the website. |
| [Montana's Big Mountain Ski Resort Pricing Model Project](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/big_mountain_ski_resort_pricing_model_project)  | This is a complete data science pipeline project helps in building a pricing model for Montana ski resort tickets. |
| [SQL Data Modeling using MySQL project](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/data_modeling_MySQL_project) | SQL project shows data modeling, implemented using MySQL, including the schema design, Entity Relationship Diagram, data dictionary, data insertion, and querying for an HR management system. |
| [Statistical Modeling in MATLAB - Research Publication](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/statistical_modeling_matlab) | Highlights of my research work at Onsala Space Observatory, I used MATLAB to statistically model GPS satellite data spanning multiple years. I processed and modeled the raw data, created residual plots to identify trends, and validated my results by comparing them with independent models. Also, presented my findings at a European geodetic conference. |
