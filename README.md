### Hi there, I am a Data Scientist 👋 

### You can find my Data Science Portfolio projects and previous work here: ###

| Topic  | Summary |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Understanding Weather and Crime relationship using Machine Learning - Omdena](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/weather_crime_relationship_houston_omdena)  | End-to-end machine learning project about understanding the relationship between crime and weather in Houston, TX. |
| [Twitter Text and Sentiment Analysis on COVID-19 data using NLP Project](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/twitter_text_classification_sentiment_analysis_project)  | Complete data science project focusing on COVID-19 Twitter data to analyze sentiments and text, including data cleaning and formatting, data wrangling, Tokenization, Lemmatization, and EDA. TD-IDF, feature selection to Machine Learning models using Natural Language Processing followed by hyperparameter tuning and feature importance, achieved 64% training and 63% testing accuracy. |
| [New York Airbnb Price Prediction using Machine Learning Project](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/nyc_airbnb_price_prediction_project)  | This is an end-to-end data science pipeline project that involves predicting the price of Airbnb listings across the five boroughs of New York, achieved R-squared = 57%, MSE = 0.19, MAE = 0.14. |
| [H&M Fashion Recommendation System using Machine Learning project](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/h-m_recommendation_system_ml_project) | Scrapped data from Kaggle to build a Recommendation System from data gathering to data wrangling, and exploratory data analysis to get insights of the data. |
| [Montana's Big Mountain Ski Resort Pricing Model Project](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/big_mountain_ski_resort_pricing_model_project)  | This is a complete data science pipeline project helps in building a pricing model for Montana ski resort tickets. |
| [SQL Data Modeling using MySQL project](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/data_modeling_MySQL_project) | SQL project shows data modeling, implemented using MySQL, including the schema design, ERD, data dictionary, data insertion, and querying for an HR management system. |
| [Statistical Modeling in MATLAB - Research Publication](https://github.com/ttariqaziz/statistical_modeling_matlab) | Highlights of my research work in MATLAB, statistical modeling of the unstructured raw data from GPS satellites for several years. Data modeling and processing, followed by different residual plots including trends and root mean square. Ultimately, the result was compared with independent data set models for validation. The results were also presented at a European conference. |
